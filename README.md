# hello-world
tutorial repository

Hello,
I am a graduate student in the Physics Department at University of Hawai'i at Manoa, and collaborator on the Neutron Time Cube project. I created this GitHub account to share the code I create with fellow collaborators. Unpublished work will not be publicly shared on this account, but all of my tutorial and textbook code will.
